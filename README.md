# engine-jinja

Jinja rendering engine for use in Wizard projects

## Local Build

1. Install dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install nuitka
```

2. Build the library from Python source:

```sh
make lib-python
```

3. Build wrapper with C API for FFI:

```sh
make lib-wrapper
```

Here you need to know the Python version you are using, in this case it is Python 3.13. Also, on MacOS you may want to use .dylib instead of .so.

## Runtime

To use the library, you need to:

1. Have Python runtime installed (matching the version used to build the library).
2. Copy the built shared library (`.so` and alt. `.dylib` files) to your project directory.
3. Link to the libraries correctly (using `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or similar environment variables).

## Interface

The library provides a C API for rendering Jinja templates. You can use the following functions:

```c
char* render_jinja(const char* input_str);

void free_string(char* str);
```

For simplicity, the function works with JSON-serialized strings:

* `input_str` is a JSON-serialized string containing the Jinja templates and contexts:
  - `templates`: array of Jinja templates to render (0 to n)
  - `contexts`: array of contexts (JSON values) passed to templates (0 to n)
* returns a JSON-serialized string with the rendered templates or error information, list of objects with the following fields:
  - `ok`: if the rendering was successful
  - `result`: the rendered template
  - `message`: the error message if rendering failed

The iteration works as follows:
- If there are multiple templates, they are rendered in the order they are provided.
- For each template, it is rendered with all provided contexts in the order they are given.
- Thus, there the result is a Cartesian product of templates and contexts.

The returned string should be freed by the caller using the `free_string` function when no longer needed.
